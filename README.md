# SL multiple image catalog of the Bullet Cluster
-------------------------------------------- 

For SL sources without spectroscopic redshifts, we treat their redshifts as free parameters, constrained by prior intervals based on the uncertainties from photometric redshift estimates. 
For multiple images without any redshift information, and cannot be converged within the prior, we set its prior interval to $z_{model}=[z_{cluster}+0.1, 15]$.
